# KBH-KBC
clone of real kbc system

###introduction
---------------
- i made this for my college event kaun banega hazarpati in techfest named convergence-2k16,uvpce!it's seem totally impossible to make system 
  that can create env like real kbc show but i try to make and got succesed and made this software in week!i think this type of system really 
  need some one that's why i uploaded on github.

###installation
---------------
- first step you need xammp or wamp already need to install on your pc.
- after that copy directory in htdocs.
- also import database that i already includes in proect with phpmyadmin.
- website is ready just enter the url in browser like http://localhost/kbh-kbc/
   
   improve it if you get some feature missing and also contribute to this project!

###setup set
-----------
- if you want kbc like screens than you can use tightvnc to copy screen locally but that needs two pc.
- you can also clone screens with using hdmi splitter but that is quite costly.

###how to use!!
---------------
- there is two main url as following.
  - http://localhost/kbh-kbc/
  - http://localhost/kbh-kbc/next_que.php
- first url is home screen that what user can see.
- and second url is for add the next question by adding id in text box.

- project architecture is simple but you need to spend some time to understand whole project!
